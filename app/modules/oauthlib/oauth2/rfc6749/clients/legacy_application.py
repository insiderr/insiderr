    The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in
    cases where the resource owner has a trust relationship with the
    client, such as the device operating system or a highly privileged
    application.  The authorization server should take special care when
    enabling this grant type, and only allow it when other flows are not
    viable.

    The grant type is suitable for clients capable of obtaining the
    resource owner's credentials (username and password, typically using
    an interactive form).  It is also used to migrate existing clients
    using direct authentication schemes such as HTTP Basic or Digest
    authentication to OAuth by converting the stored credentials to an
    access token.

    The method through which the client obtains the resource owner
    credentials is beyond the scope of this specification.  The client
    MUST discard the credentials once an access token has been obtained.

        format per `Appendix B`_ in the HTTP request entity-body:

        :param username:    The resource owner username.

        If the client type is confidential or the client was issued client
        credentials (or assigned other authentication requirements), the
